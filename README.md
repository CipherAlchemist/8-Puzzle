# 8puzzle
The following project is a working Java 8-puzzle game that takes in puzzle states from csv files and solves them if possible. This project explores problem solving by search. The AI algorithms used in this project include the  A* search and Local beam search. 

Each puzzle state is represented in the state class. The graphical representation of puzzle state is represented in the node class. The puzzle class represents an 8-puzzle. The PuzzleSolver class are objects that can take in puzzles from csv files and solve them. Each file has a corresponding testing file.
